# Learning ElectronJS (and ReactJS, with TypeScript)
This repo contains sample ElectronJS project(s) written in TypeScript to help me get up-to-speed with creating desktop applications in a web dev environment, rather than what I'm used to in Unity/C# programming!

## Creating a New ReactJS + ElectronJS + TypeScript Projet
1. Run `npx create-react-app .`
